Project running on Azure App Service
![Project running on Azure App Service](/images/)

Project cloned into Azure Cloud Shell

Passing tests that are displayed after running the make all command from the Makefile

Output of a test run

Successful deploy of the project in Azure Pipelines. Note the official documentation should be referred to and double checked as you setup CI/CD.

Running Azure App Service from Azure Pipelines automatic deployment

Successful prediction from deployed flask app in Azure Cloud Shell. Use this file as a template for the deployed prediction. The output should look similar to this:

udacity@Azure:~$ ./make_predict_azure_app.sh
Port: 443
{"prediction":[20.35373177134412]}
Output of streamed log files from deployed application
